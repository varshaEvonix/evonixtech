Terms of Use
Effective September 1, 2015

These Terms of Use (The "Terms of Use") govern use of the websites and services (the "Services") of Stumuch, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its affiliates, "Stumuch"), in addition to any supplemental terms applicable to any particular features, content and functionality of the Services, which such supplemental terms are incorporated by reference into the Terms of Use. By using the Services, Users agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, all applicable laws and all conditions or policies referenced here (collectively, the "Terms"). Stumuch may amend the Terms at any time by posting a revised version of the Terms on our Services. Access to or continued use of the Services after the effective date of the revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

Definitions
In these Terms, we refer to those raising funds as "Campaign Owners" and to their fundraising campaigns as "Campaigns." We refer to those contributing funds as "Contributors" and to the funds they contribute as "Contributions." Campaign Owners, Contributors and other visitors to the Services are referred to collectively as "Users."

Stumuch is a Venue
Stumuch is an online crowdfunding venue for people and entities seeking to raise funds for their own Campaigns and to contribute to the Campaigns of others. Campaign Owners can offer gifts or rewards in the form of tangible items or intangible services (collectively, "Perks") to Contributors. Perks are not offered for sale. Stumuch makes no representations about the quality, safety, morality or legality of any Campaign, Perk or Contribution or the truth or accuracy of User Content (as defined below) posted on the Services. Stumuch does not represent that Campaign Owners will deliver Perks or that Contributions will be used as described in the Campaign. Users use the Services at their own risk.

Eligibility to Use the Services
Users under 18 years of age are not eligible to use the Services without consent. Users between the ages of 13 and 17, can use the Services with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years old, provided such parent or legal guardian also agrees to be bound by the Terms and agrees to be responsible for such use of the Services. Users suspended from using the Services are not eligible to use the Services. Stumuch reserves the right to refuse use of the Services to anyone and to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove or suspend any Campaign, Contribution, or the Services at any time for any reason without liability.

Prohibited Campaigns
Campaign Owners are not permitted to create a Campaign to raise funds for illegal activities, to cause harm to people or property, or to scam others. If the Campaign is claiming to do the impossible or it's just plain phony, don't post it. Users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with their Campaigns, including offering Perks and using Contributions. Campaign Owners shall not make any false or misleading statements in connection with their Campaigns.</div>
